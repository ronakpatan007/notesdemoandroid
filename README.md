# Android Navigation Architecture Component Demo

This project contains a comprehensive sample of using the [Navigation Architecture Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) by way of a simple Notes app--no domain knowledge needed to understand the purpose of this app.

## Functionality included
1) List notes
2) View single note
3) Edit a note
4) Delete a note
5) Deep link to a note
6) Animate a transition between screens
7) Connecting `Nav Drawer` with your navigation graph.
8) Configuring type-safe arguments between navigation components (in this case, Fragments)

## Design Pattern
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is used to make the architecture cleaner, more readable and maintainable. Notes are stored and managed in memory within the domain layer (this sample is about Navigation and not full-blown [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/jshvarts/ConductorMVP) after all).   

## Bonus
This Project contains steps needed to migrate from support library to AndroidX namespace. For more details, see [AndroidX Refactoring docs](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/refactor)
